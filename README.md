1. Download and extract the zip file from google classroom.
2. cd into the project directory and create a new directory called build.
3. Now cd into the build directory and run cmake .. to configure the project.
4. Once the project is configured, run make in the same directory to build the project.
5. Once the project is built without any errors, you can run ctest to run all the tests for the
TCP receiver.
6. As you can see, all the tests will fail. Once you have implemented all the classes
correctly, all the tests must pass.
